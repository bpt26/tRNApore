'''
This module serves as a collection for two of the HMMs built for modeling nanopore data.
HMMs must be written using Yet Another Hidden Markov Model (yahmm) package. When adding a new
HMM to the list, please follow the pattern set up, and also remember to update the factory at
the bottom. Use the format that the string is the same as the name of the function which returns
that HMM. 

ModularDomainProfileModel was written by Jakob Houser based on example models provided by 
Jacob Schrieber in hmm.py from PyPore

ModularDomainProfileModel2 is a rewrite of ModularDomainProfileModel that takes in
the two lists of profiles and board functions that correspond to the protein domain that
needs to be modeled.

tRNAProfileModel is similar to ModularDomainProfileModel2 with a new way to model inserts when not in a fork.

def ModularDomainProfileModel( board_funcs, profiles, name, insert ):
    '''
    Mostly similar to ModuleLocalProfileModel. This model does not support
    insert boards between regions but instead requires a list of board functions
    corresponding to the list of profiles. The two lists should be the same length
    so that board_funcs[i] is the board function to use for the profile at
    profiles[i].
    
    This model is intended to be used with protein modeling where each board_func
    and profile corresponds to a protein domain that needs to be modeled. Critically,
    it is not possible to backslip between domains, though there are no restrictions
    on what transitions are allowed between states within a board_func.

    This model is intended to be used with protein modeling where each board_funcs
    and profile corresponds to a protein domain that needs to be modeled. Backslips are
    allowed if the board_funcs passed in supports it.
